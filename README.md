We implemented 3 variants of agents that play pokemon showdown locally against each other.
- A Random agent, that makes random moves/switches and it's our baseline to evaluate the performance of the remaining agents. 
- A Reactive agent, that attempts to inflict the maximum dmg to the opponent, if he can't cause damage he switches to the pokemon that has the highest damage against the opponent. 
- A Proactive agent, takes into account the opponents available actions and the game plan, and aims to position itself advantageously for future turns.
